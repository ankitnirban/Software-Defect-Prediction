# Software-Defect-Prediction

#The given work is a prediction model used to predicting whether a particular piece of code is faulty or not.

#The speciality is that unlike the conventional software defect prediction models, this work tries to visualise code modules as images and use 
image classification techniques to go about achieving the classification.

#Particularly, Alexnet architecture has been utilized for the prediction. The work opens possibility of better techniques of software defect prediction by utilizing 
the state of the art image classification we have, a new way to look at a problem and thus achieve higher degrees of success in accomplishing the task.
